@pamil could you spare a moment to look at this? I would prefer to use official package over my forked repo ðŸ˜¸

@pamil any updates? I would prefer not to use forks ðŸ˜¬

Hello ðŸ‘‹

@pamil is on vacation ðŸŒ´, and won't be available on GitHub until 10th od December. I'm not sure if I will find a time to check and review it before that date. Hopefully, we may be able to work on it during SymfonyCon or something.

I heard that SymfonyCon was tremendous and the hack day is coming up shortly.

Hope you had a good time there. If you anyone manage somehow to look at this PR, I would be delighted ðŸ˜‰

Adrian, we will need a little rebase here ;)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

by adiq at 2018-12-09T15:14:21Z

@lchrusciel I have updated this PR. Rebased from master, removed obsolete docblocks and fixed some coding style based on ECS. Tests are green, hope everything is fine now ðŸ•º
